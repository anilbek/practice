_**Faulty Steel Plate Classification File:**_

This dataset comes from research by Semeion, Research Center of Sciences of Communication. The original aim of the research was to correctly classify the type of surface defects in stainless steel plates, with six types of possible defects (plus "other"). The Input vector was made up of 27 indicators that approximately [describe] the geometric shape of the defect and its outline. According to the research paper, Semeion was commissioned by the Centro Sviluppo Materiali (Italy) for this task and therefore it is not possible to provide details on the nature of the 27 indicators used as Input vectors or the types of the 6 classes of defects.

_**AWS Faulty Steel Plate Classification File:**_

I use a very simplified version of the code in faulty steel plate classification to perform the same operations in AWS SageMaker such as preprocessing, training, and deploying. I also use other SageMaker tools such as Debugger, Prediction Monitoring, Deploying, Testing, and more.

_**Is Bankasi File**_

I build a multilabel classification model to predict which 3 out of 9 menus a bank app's user is going to most likely need while they are using the functionalities of the app using a bank's data.

_**MLflow File**_

I use a simple dataset to build an end-to-end pipeline using MLflow that can do everything from obtaining data to performing inference in addition to implementing performance monitoring on a wine quality dataset.

_**SVNH Deep Learning Notebook**_

I use the SVNH dataset to apply MLP and CNN to build image classification models. I used Data Visualization, Tensorflow, Keras Tuner, and Transfer Learning in addition to the generic DL procedure.

_**Fake News Detection File**_

I build fake news classification models using Word2vec, Doc2vec, and HuggingFace transformers.
